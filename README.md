This app is called Billio.
It will consist of the files that are used to make up my app for a project in school called an NEA for my Computer Science A-Level qualification. It will be written in Javascript using 
React for the front-end and Python and Flask for the backend, and my database will be an SQLite database since this is a small project and I won't need to store much data and it will be 
fine running locally.
